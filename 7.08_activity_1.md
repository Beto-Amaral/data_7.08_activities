# 7.08 Activity 1

In this exercise we will go back to the customer churn data from the last lab (the dataset can also be found in the `files_for_activities` folder)

- Implement cross validation along with logistic regression and decision tree classifier on the data
  - Create a pipeline as shown in the class example
  - Note: you can directly use the upsampled data from SMOTE technique. You can use the following code to set up for this activity
  
  ```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

churnData = pd.read_csv('Customer-Churn.csv')
churnData['TotalCharges']  = pd.to_numeric(churnData['TotalCharges'], errors='coerce')
churnData['TotalCharges'] = churnData['TotalCharges'].fillna(np.mean(churnData['TotalCharges']))

from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
smote = SMOTE()
X = churnData[['tenure', 'SeniorCitizen','MonthlyCharges', 'TotalCharges']]
transformer = StandardScaler().fit(X)
X = transformer.transform(X)
y = churnData['Churn']
X_sm, y_sm = smote.fit_sample(X, y)
y_sm.value_counts()
  ```
