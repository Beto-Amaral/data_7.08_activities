# 7.08 Activity 1

In this exercise we will go back to the customer churn data from the last lab (the dataset can also be found in the `files_for_activities` folder)

- Implement cross validation along with logistic regression and decision tree classifier on the data
  - Create a pipeline as shown in the class example
  - Note: you can directly use the upsampled data from SMOTE technique
